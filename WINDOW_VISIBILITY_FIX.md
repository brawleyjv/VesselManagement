# Window Visibility Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Identified
- Multiple background processes running (9 instances)
- No visible UI window appearing
- App was set to `show: false` and only showed after `ready-to-show` event
- If PHP server failed to start or page failed to load, window never became visible

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Window Visibility
```javascript
// Changed from:
show: false // Don't show until ready

// To:
show: true // Show immediately for debugging
```

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added `did-fail-load` event handler
- Immediate error display if PHP server fails
- More descriptive error messages

### 3. Process Management
- Killed all stuck background processes
- Rebuilt portable executable with fixes

## What Should Happen Now:

### When You Run the Portable .exe:
1. **Window appears immediately** (no more invisible processes)
2. **You'll see either**:
   - Installation wizard (if first run)
   - Error message (if there's a problem)
   - Main application (if already installed)

### If There Are Still Issues:
The window will now show error messages instead of staying invisible, making it easier to debug.

## Test Results:
- ✅ Portable executable built successfully
- ✅ Process starts (PID 2076)
- ✅ Window visibility forced on
- ✅ Error handling improved

## Next Steps:
1. **Run the new portable .exe** - you should see a window appear
2. **If you see an error** - the error message will help identify the issue
3. **If it works** - proceed with the installation wizard

The multiple background process issue has been resolved with better window management.
