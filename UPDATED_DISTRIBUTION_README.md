## 🔒 **License Protection Features Added**

### **1. Hardware Fingerprinting**
- Unique Machine ID per installation
- Based on MAC addresses, CPU, hostname, disk serial
- Cannot be easily duplicated or shared

### **2. License Binding**
- First activation binds license to Machine ID
- Subsequent uses must match same Machine ID
- "Already activated elsewhere" error prevents sharing

### **3. Database Tracking**
- `machine_id` column in licenses table
- `license_activations` audit trail table
- Real-time validation via API

### **4. Anti-Piracy Protection**
- **Before:** 1 license could run on 10 boats illegally
- **After:** 10 boats require 10 separate licenses
- **Revenue Impact:** Up to 10x increase in legitimate sales

## 🎯 **Customer Experience**

### **Legitimate Users:**
- ✅ **Unlimited boats** per licensed installation
- ✅ **Easy setup** with automatic machine detection
- ✅ **Hardware replacement** support (contact admin)
- ✅ **Offline demo** licenses for testing

### **License Sharing Attempts:**
- ❌ **Clear error message:** "License already activated on another installation"
- ❌ **Blocked access** to main features
- ❌ **Audit trail** of attempted violations

## 📊 **Business Model Changes**

### **Pricing Structure:**
- **Per Installation** instead of per company
- **Unlimited boats** per installation (value proposition)
- **Volume discounts** for companies with multiple boats

### **Example:**
```
Company with 10 boats:
- Before: 1 license for $X (easily shared)
- After: 10 licenses for $10X (properly protected)
- Discount: Offer 8 licenses for $8X (20% volume discount)
```
