# 🔧 Fixed Download Links - Portable Version

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

**Problem:** Some links were still pointing to old `Vessel Data Logger-Setup.exe` filename
**Solution:** Updated to use `Vessel Data Logger-Portable.exe`

## 📝 **Files Updated:**

### **Critical Fix:**
- ✅ `api/secure-download.php` - Updated installer path from Setup.exe to Portable.exe

### **Already Correct:**
- ✅ `download.html` - Already pointing to Portable.exe
- ✅ `landing.html` - Points to download.html (correct)
- ✅ `landing-script.js` - PayPal redirect to download.html (correct)

## 🔗 **Download Flow Now Works:**

```
1. Landing page → "Download Free Trial" button
2. Redirects to → download.html  
3. Download button → dist/Vessel Data Logger-Portable.exe ✅

OR

1. Purchase via PayPal → Success page
2. Redirects to → download.html
3. Download button → dist/Vessel Data Logger-Portable.exe ✅

OR  

1. Email with license → Secure download link
2. api/secure-download.php → dist/Vessel Data Logger-Portable.exe ✅
```

## 🎯 **Ready for Upload**

All customer-facing files now correctly reference:
**`Vessel Data Logger-Portable.exe`**

The documentation files (.md) still reference the old name but those are not customer-facing and don't affect the actual download process.
